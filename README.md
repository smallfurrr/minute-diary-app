# minute.
A daily diary app that encourages people to take a minute for self-care each day, featuring
mood analytics which empower users to find and combat the root of their negative emotions. 

## Why I Created minute
Most working professionals in Singapore lead a hectic life. In the office, I felt tired and upset all the time - and so did most of the people around me. I also observed that a result of this lifestyle was a lack of attention to our own health, both physical and mental. 

By creating minute, I hope to provide an safe space for users to explore their feelings as well as help them gain insight on the causes behind them.  

## User Flow/Wireframes
The initial envisioned flow of the app can be seen <a href="https://ibb.co/k5xPqr5">here</a>.

The app was designed for people to be able to access its main features quickly as possible. A typical user flow for an exising user would be:

- Login from the home page
- Land on the Add Entry page where they can add an entry + tag it with their current mood + the reason behind that mood
- After entry is logged, they are given a choice to view all entries, view their Mood Report, or add another entry
- If they choose to view their Mood Report they are brought to another page with data analytics on all their logged entries. Mindfulness podcasts are suggested in accordance with their primary mood. E.g if they are frequently "Angry", the podcasts displayed will have a theme of relaxation or forgiveness
- User can choose to favorite podcasts and then access them directly from their Favorites page
